# TPhotonCrudeMockup
A very crude, messy playground of different techniques to see how I want to implement the TPhoton system in TEngine.

The solution settled on was ray tracing, with illumination along path.
This allows for realistic reflection/diffusion/shadows/refraction. 

TODO: Organize code, parametrize magic numbers, falloff function.
TODO: write GLSL shaders for ray tracing.
